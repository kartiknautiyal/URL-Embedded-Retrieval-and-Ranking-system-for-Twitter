# URL-Embedded-Retrieval-and-Ranking-system-for-Twitter

https://exquisite-chebakia-9a513b.netlify.app/

We have implemented an Information Retrieval engine to retrieve highly relevant link embeddings from Tweets. 

We extract tweets with links based on a user query. 
We then scrape unique urls obtained from the tweets. 
We implemented ranking algorithms such as TF-IDF with cosine similarity, BM25, PL2 and InL2,  etc. 
Finally, we obtain and display top results matching the user query.

This project is a collaborative effort among the following graduate students at WPI, as a part of CS547 coursework:
Janani Sankarasubramanian,
Kartik Nautiyal,
